# STAIRS_FOR_INVENTOR
Visual studio project to create an executable that insert Stairs, Ladders, Railings and platforms.
This project create not an add-in but an executable that runs outside Inventor.
I started in 2015 with this project and tested it in the 2025 version, it still works.
Enjoy tweaking it...
