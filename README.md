# STAIRS_FOR_INVENTOR
This Visual Studio project creates an executable for inserting stairs, ladders, railings, and platforms into Inventor. Unlike an add-in, this is a standalone executable that runs outside of Inventor.

I started this project in 2015 and recently tested it in the 2025 version of Inventorâ€”it still works perfectly!

Feel free to tweak and modify it as you see fit.
